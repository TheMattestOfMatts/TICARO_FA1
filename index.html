	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p>The start of my workday as a doctor would begin early, often before sunrise. I’d wake up around 5:30 AM, take a quick shower, and get dressed in clean scrubs or a white coat, depending on my department. My stethoscope and ID badge would be ready by the door, along with a pair of comfortable shoes for the long hours ahead.</p>
	      <p>After grabbing a light breakfast and maybe a cup of coffee, I’d head to the hospital or clinic, where the environment is already buzzing with nurses prepping charts and patients arriving for early appointments. The air smells faintly of disinfectant, and the halls echo with footsteps and quiet conversations. I’d check in with my team, review the day’s schedule, and begin rounds, for I am ready to diagnose, treat, and care for those who need me most.</p>

	      <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
	      <p>By midday, my tasks shift into full gear as I begin attending to patients, reviewing medical charts, and performing check-ups or procedures. I work closely with nurses, medical assistants, and sometimes specialists, depending on the cases I encounter. Communication and teamwork are essential, especially when coordinating care or discussing treatment plans.</p>
	      <p>I rely on tools like stethoscopes, blood pressure monitors, and digital health records to assess and track patient progress. My skills in diagnosis, empathy, and decision-making are constantly in use as I navigate each case with care and precision, ensuring every patient receives the attention they need.</p>

	      <p>It shows how being a doctor is more than just diagnosing and treating, it's about connecting with people, solving real-life problems, and making a difference every single day. The junior doctor’s reflections highlight the emotional rewards of the job, the teamwork involved, and the constant learning that keeps the work meaningful. It’s inspiring to see how even the busiest moments can be filled with purpose when you're doing what you love.</p>

	      <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
	      <p>Dr. Sue Masel started out as a city girl but chose to practice medicine in Goondiwindi, a small rural town in Queensland, Australia. Over the past 21 years, she’s become a vital part of the community—not just as a doctor, but also as a mentor, beekeeper, and advocate for rural health. In the YouTube video An inspiring story of a rural doctor – Dr Sue Masel, she shares how fulfilling it is to care for generations of families and how rural medicine offers a unique blend of challenge and connection</p>
	      <p>Her story reminds me that being a doctor means more than treating illness—it’s about adapting to your environment, listening to your patients, and becoming part of their lives. Whether she’s helping a farmer, guiding young medical students, or shaping health policy through the RDAQ Foundation, Dr. Masel proves that true impact doesn’t depend on location—it depends on heart.</p>
